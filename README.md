Barcode Buddy

=====================================

This app helps users keep track of the price of past purchases of products. To make it easy to
store the products it uses a barcode scanner and looks up product information. It allows the user 
to view products that they have added. The user accounts are handled by Googleâ€™s authentication APIs 
which is built into the Android OS. The product list screen shows the last purchase price, and if 
you go into the details it shows the average price for that UPC aggregated across all users, and a 
photo if the user uploaded one.
